### Actionscript 3.0 Obfuscator

Homepage: http://github.com/shapedbyregret/actionscript-3-obfuscator/tree/master

Options: There are currently only 3 options that you can change by setting them to either "True" or "False".

	removeComments: When set to "True", will remove all comments from your .as file. This includes both block comments (all text between "/*" and "*/") and single line comments (all text following "//").

	changeVarName: Changes all variable, constant, and function names to a random number prefixed with an underscore. Eg "var aNumber:int" becomes "var _324:int".

	encodestrings: Converts string literals into their hex equivalent. Eg. "apple" becomes "\x61\x70\x70\x6c\x65"


Instructions: To run the script, open a terminal and type in:
	
	$ python /path/to/obfuscator.py /path/to/Filename.as /path/to/NewFilename.as
	
So to test the examples provided, you would open a terminal in the folder where obfuscator.py is located and type:
	
	$ python obfuscator.py example/Bubble_Sort.as example/Bubble_Sort_Obfs.as
	
If a new file name is not provided, the script will automatically write to Filename_Obfs.as. The script will change the constructor name to match your new filename as well.

Notes: Script was developed using Python 2.6 and has not been tested with any other versions. If you run into any errors, feel free to contact me at the e-mail address above.
